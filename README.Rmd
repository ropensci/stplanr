```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(stplanr)
```

**stplanr** is a package for sustainable transport planning with R.

It provides functions for solving common problems in transport planning and modelling, such as how to best get from point A to point B. The overall aim is to provide a reproducible, transparent and accessible toolkit to help people better understand transport systems and inform policy.

The initial work on the project was funded by the Department of Transport
([DfT](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport))
as part of the development of the Propensity to Cycle Tool
([PCT](http://pct.bike/)). The PCT uses origin-destination data as the basis of spatial analysis
and modelling work to identify where bicycle paths are most needed. See
the package vignette (e.g. via `vignette("introducing-stplanr")`) 
or an [academic paper on the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5198/jtlu.2016.862)
for more information on how it can be used. This README gives some basics.

**stplanr** should be useful to researchers everywhere.
The function `route_graphhopper()`, for example, works anywhere in the world
using the [graphhopper](https://graphhopper.com/) routing API and
`read_table_builder()` reads-in Australian data. We welcome contributions that make
transport research easier worldwide.

## Key functions

Data frames representing flows between origins and destinations
must be combined with geo-referenced zones or points to generate meaningful
analyses and visualisations of 'flows' or origin-destination (OD) data.
**stplanr** facilitates this with
`od2line()`, which takes flow and geographical data as inputs and
outputs spatial data. Some example data is provided in the package:

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(stplanr)
data(cents, flow)
```

Let's take a look at this data:

```{r}
flow[1:3, 1:3] # typical form of flow data
cents[1:3,] # points representing origins and destinations
```

These datasets can be combined as follows:

```{r plot1, warning=FALSE}
travel_network <- od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents)
w <- flow$All / max(flow$All) *10
plot(travel_network, lwd = w)
```

The package can also allocate flows to the road network, e.g. with [CycleStreets.net](https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/) and the OpenStreetMap Routing Machine ([OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)) API interfaces.
These are supported in `route_*()` functions such as `route_cyclestreets` and `route_osrm()`:

Route functions take lat/lon inputs:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trip <-
  route_osrm(from = c(-1, 53), to = c(-1.1, 53))
```

and place names, found using the Google Map API:

```{r cycle-trip, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
if(!Sys.getenv("CYCLESTREET") == ""){
  trip <- route_cyclestreet("Bradford, UK", "Leeds, Yorkshire", plan = "balanced")
  plot(trip)
}
```

We can replicate this call multiple times using `line2route`.

```{r plot2, results='hide', message=FALSE}
intrazone <- travel_network$Area.of.residence == travel_network$Area.of.workplace
travel_network <- travel_network[!intrazone,]
t_routes <- line2route(travel_network, route_fun = route_osrm)
plot(t_routes)
```

Another way to visualise this is with the leaflet package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addPolylines(data = t_routes)
```

For more examples, `example("line2route")`.

`overline` is a function which takes a series of route-allocated lines,
splits them into unique segments and aggregates
the values of overlapping lines. This can represent where there will be
most traffic on the transport system, as illustrated
below. 

```{r rnet, warning=FALSE}
t_routes$All <- travel_network$All
rnet <- overline(t_routes, attrib = "All", fun = sum)

lwd <- rnet$All / mean(rnet$All)
plot(rnet, lwd = lwd)
points(cents)
```

## Installation

To install the stable version, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stplanr")
```

The development version can be installed using **devtools**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr")
library(stplanr)
```

stplanr depends on rgdal, which can be tricky to install.

### Installing stplanr on Linux and Mac

**splanr** depends on **rgdal** which can be installed on Ubuntu, for example, with:

```
sudo apt install r-cran-rgdal
```

To install `gdal` binaries on other distributions please see here: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries

**stplanr** also depends on **sf**. Installation instructions for Mac, Ubuntu and other Linux distros can be found here: https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installing

Instructions to install `gdal` and `Quartz` are provided at https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio#install and https://www.xquartz.org/ respectively (Quartz is required for R - as described [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)).




## Funtions, help and contributing

The current list of available functions can be seen with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lsf.str("package:stplanr", all = TRUE)
```

To get internal help on a specific function, use the standard way.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?od2line
```

## Dependencies

**stplanr** imports many great packages that it depends on. Many thanks to the developers of these tools:

```{r}
desc = read.dcf("DESCRIPTION")
headings = dimnames(desc)[[2]]
fields = which(headings %in% c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pkgs = paste(desc[fields], collapse = ", ")
pkgs = gsub("\n", " ", pkgs)
strsplit(pkgs, ",")[[1]]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: explore dependencies
install.packages("miniCRAN")
library(miniCRAN)
tags <- "stplanr"
pkgDep(tags)
dg <- makeDepGraph(tags, enhances = TRUE)
set.seed(1)
plot(dg, legendPosition = c(-1, 1), vertex.size = 20)
library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::visnetwork(dg)
visNetwork::visIgraph(dg)
```
