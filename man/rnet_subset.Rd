\usage{
rnet_subset(

  dist = 10,
  crop = TRUE,
  min_length = 20,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{rnet_x}{The route network to be subset}

\item{rnet_y}{The subsetting route network}

\item{dist}{The buffer width around y in meters. 1 m by default.}

\item{crop}{Crop \code{rnet_x}? \code{TRUE} is the default}

\item{min_length}{Segments shorter than this multiple of dist
\emph{and} which were longer
before the cropping process will be removed. 3 by default.}

\item{rm_disconnected}{Remove ways that are}
