\usage{
rnet_join(
  rnet_x,
  rnet_y,
  dist = 5,
  length_y = TRUE,
  key_column = 1,
  subset_x = TRUE,
  dist_subset = 5,
  split_y = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rnet_x}{Target route network, the output will have the same geometries
as features in this object.}

\item{rnet_y}{Source route network. Columns from this route network object will
be copied across to the new network.}

\item{dist}{The buffer width around rnet_y in meters. 1 m by default.}

\item{length_y}{Add a new column called \code{length_y}? Useful when joining based on
length of segments (e.g. weighted mean). \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{key_column}{The index of the key (unique identifier) column in \code{rnet_x}.}

\item{subset_x}{Subset the source route network by the target network before
creating buffers? This can lead to faster and better results. Default:
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{dist_subset}{The buffer distance in m to apply when breaking up the
source object \code{rnet_y}. Default: 5.}

\item{split_y}{Should the second route network be split at the start and
end points of LINESTRING features in the first? \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{rnet_subset}.}
}
\description{
This is a spatial join function that is enables adding columns to a
'target' route network from a 'source' route
network that contains the base geometry, e.g. from OSM
}
\details{
The output is an sf object containing polygons representing
buffers around the route network in \code{rnet_x}.
The examples below demonstrate how to join attributes from
a route network object created with the function \code{\link[=overline]{overline()}} onto
OSM geometries.

Note: The main purpose of this function is to join an ID from \code{rnet_x}
onto \code{rnet_y}. Subsequent steps, e.g. with \code{\link[dplyr:mutate-joins]{dplyr::inner_join()}}
are needed to join the attributes back onto \code{rnet_x}.
There are rarely 1-to-1 relationships between spatial network geometries
so we take care when using this function.

See \href{https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/505}{#505} for details
and a link to an interactive example of inputs and outputs shown below.
