Description: Tools for transport planning with an emphasis on spatial transport
    data and non-motorized modes. Enables common transport planning tasks including:
    downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic "desire lines"
    from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and via
    interfaces to routing services such as <https://cyclestreets.net/> and
    calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing.
    The package implements the 'travel flow aggregration' method
    described in Morgan and Lovelace (2020) <doi:10.1177/2399808320942779>.
    Further information on the package's aim and scope can be found
    in the vignettes and in a paper in the R Journal
    (Lovelace and Ellison 2018) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053>.
    This package Suggests the 'pct' package which at the time of writing
    is unavailable on CRAN. You can install it from the repository
    'itsleeds/pct' on GitHub.
