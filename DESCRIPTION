Description: Tools for transport planning with an emphasis on spatial
    transport data and non-motorized modes. Create geographic "desire
    lines" from origin-destination (OD) data (building on the 'od'
    package); calculate routes on the transport network locally and via
    interfaces to routing services such as <https://cyclestreets.net/>;
    calculate route segment attributes such as bearing.  The package
    implements the 'travel flow aggregration' method described in Morgan
    and Lovelace (2020) <doi:10.1177/2399808320942779>.  Further
    information on the package's aim and scope can be found in the
    vignettes and in a paper in the R Journal (Lovelace and Ellison 2018)
    <doi:10.32614/RJ-2018-053>.
