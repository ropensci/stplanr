  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach to the analysis of travel to work flows by combining separate geodemographic classifications of origins and destinations. A new classification of workplace areas is used in combination with an established official classification of residential areas. The approach is demonstrated using an empirical analysis of 26 million commuting flows in England and Wales, measured between the smallest residential and workplace areas in the 2011 census. The analysis demonstrates potential insights to be gained by this approach, revealing clear patterns in the structure of travel to work flows between geodemographic clusters. Our broad approach is not limited to use in specific countries and has potential application for use with data from non-census sources.},

  abstract = {Data collection activities related to travel require large amounts of financial and human resources to be conducted successfully. When available resources are scarce, the information hidden in these data sets needs to be exploited, both to increase their added value and to gain support among decision makers not to discontinue such efforts. This study assessed the use of a data mining technique, association analysis, to understand better the patterns of mode use from the 2009 U.S. National Household Travel Survey. Only variables related to self-reported levels of use of the different transportation means are considered, along with those useful to the socioeconomic characterization of the respondents. Association rules potentially showed a substitution effect between cars and public transportation, in economic terms but such an effect was not observed between public transportation and nonmotorized modes (e.g., bicycling and walking). This effect was a policy-relevant finding, because transit marketing should be targeted to car drivers rather than to bikers or walkers for real improvement in the environmental performance of any transportation system. Given the competitive advantage of private modes extensively discussed in the literature, modal diversion from car to transit is seldom observed in practice. However, after such a factor was controlled, the results suggest that modal diversion should mainly occur from cars to transit rather than from nonmotorized modes to transit.},

In this paper, the use of social networks for conducting transport surveys is presented. The integration with e-mail providers broadens their use and makes them more suitable for data collection. In addition, statistics regarding discussions (tweets) with words related to the survey's subject were extracted from Twitter and evaluated. Since the applications of social and other internet networks are always developed, their use for internet surveys should be further examined in the future.},

  abstract = {Engagement in walking for recreation can contribute to healthy aging. Although there is growing evidence that the neighborhood environment can influence walking for recreation, the amount of such evidence in relation to older adults is scarce and limited to Western low-density urban locations. Asian urban environments are typified by distinctive environmental and cultural characteristics that may yield different patterns to those observed in Western countries. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine associations of perceived environmental attributes with overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation in Chinese elders (65+ years) residing in Hong Kong, an ultradense Asian metropolis. A sample of 484 elders was recruited from 32 neighborhoods stratified by socio-economic status and walkability (dwelling and intersection densities). Validated questionnaires measuring perceived neighborhood environment and weekly minutes of overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation were interviewer administered. Results showed that the level of recreational walking was twice to four times higher than that reported in Western adults and elders. While overall walking for recreation showed a general lack of associations with perceived environmental attributes, within-neighborhood recreational walking was positively related with proximity of recreational facilities, infrastructure for walking, indoor places for walking, and presence of bridge/overpasses connecting to services. Age and educational attainment moderated the associations with several perceived environmental attributes with older and less-educated participants showing stronger associations. Traditional cultural views on the benefits of physical activity and the high accessibility of facilities and pedestrian infrastructure of Hong Kong may explain the high levels of walking. Although specific neighborhood attributes, or their perception, may influence recreational walking within the neighborhood, the compactness and public transport affordability of ultradense metropolises such as Hong Kong may make it easy for elders to compensate for the lack of favorable neighborhood attributes by walking outside the neighborhood.},

  abstract = {Encouraging cycling, as part of a wider sustainable mobility strategy, is an increasingly common objective in transport planning institutions worldwide. Emerging evidence shows that providing appropriate high-quality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. To maximize the benefits and cost-effectiveness of new infrastructure, it is important to build in the right places. Cycle paths, for example, will have the greatest impact if they are constructed along 'desire lines' of greatest latent demand. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) seeks to inform such decisions by providing an evidence-based support tool that models current and potential future distributions and volumes of cycling across cities and regions. This paper describes this model and its application to case study cities in England. Origin-destination (OD) data, combined with quantitative information at the level of administrative zones, form the basis of the model, which estimates cycling potential as a function of route distance, hilliness and other factors at the OD and area level. Multiple scenarios were generated and interactively displayed. These were: 'Government Target', in which the rate of cycling doubles in England; 'Gender Equality', in which women cycle as much as men; 'Go Dutch', in which English people cycle as much as people in the Netherlands; and 'E-bikes', an exploratory analysis of increasing the distance people are willing to cycle due to new technology. The model is freely available online and can be accessed at [geo8.webarch.net/master/](http://geo8.webarch.net/master/). This paper also explains how the PCT's open source approach allows it to be deployed in new cities and countries. We conclude that the method presented has potential to assist with planning for cycling-dominated cities worldwide, which can in turn assist with the global transition away from fossil fuels.},

Click here to watch a 3-minute introductory video (or search for the book name on YouTube if the link doesn't show). ~ This book is aimed at transport planners, town planners, students in transport-related courses, policy advisors, economists, project managers, property developers, investors, politicians, journalists, and anyone else who wants to understand the process of making decisions on transport infrastructure. It is suitable for readers in any country.~ ~ The book is split into two parts. The first part is about the principles of transport modelling. This part talks about travel demand, transport networks, zones, trip matrices, the value of time, trip generation, mode split, destination choice, model calibration – lots of scary words that need explaining in order to understand the role of models in the assessment of transport projects. All modes of transport are covered: cars, buses, trains, trucks, taxis, walking, cycling and others. Hot air balloons may be the only transport mode that is hardly mentioned.~ ~ The second part of the book covers more strategic issues. It talks about the culture of transport modelling, including the management of transport modelling work, the way model outputs are communicated, and the professional environment where this is done. This part of the book also contains an honest discussion of common modelling practices which should be recommended and others which should not.~ ~ “Transport modelling for a complete beginner” will help you ensure that anything you do with a transport model remains fair, effective and based on real evidence.},
