#' Break up an sf object with LINESTRING geometry.
#'
#' This function breaks up a LINESTRING geometry into multiple LINESTRING(s). It
#' is used mainly for preserving routability of an object that is
#' created using Open Street Map data. See details,
#' [stplanr/issues/282](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/282), and
#' [stplanr/issues/416](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/416).
#'
#' A LINESTRING geometry is broken-up when one of the two following conditions
#' are met:
#' 1. two or more LINESTRINGS share a POINT which is a boundary point for some
#' LINESTRING(s), but not all of them (see the rnet_roundabout example);
#' 2. two or more LINESTRINGS share a POINT which is not in the boundary of any
#' LINESTRING (see the rnet_cycleway_intersection example).
#'
#' The problem with the first example is that, according to algorithm behind
#' `SpatialLinesNetwork()`, two LINESTRINGS are connected if and only if they
#' share at least one point in their boundaries. The roads and the roundabout
#' are clearly connected in the "real" world but the corresponding LINESTRING
#' objects do not share two distinct boundary points. In fact, by Open Street
#' Map standards, a roundabout is represented as a closed and circular
#' LINESTRING, and this implies that the roundabout is not connected to the
#' other roads according to `SpatialLinesNetwork()` definition. By the same
#' reasoning, the roads in the second example are clearly connected in the
#' "real" world, but they do not share any point in their boundaries. This
#' function is used to solve this type of problem.
#'
#' @param rnet An sf or sfc object with LINESTRING geometry representing a route
#'   network.
#' @param verbose Boolean. If TRUE, the function prints additional messages.
#' @return An sf or sfc object with LINESTRING geometry created after breaking
#'   up the input object.
