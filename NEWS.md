-   Plotting behaviour updated for `sfNetwork` objects: now only plots the geometry by default.
-   Improved documentation for `SpatialLinesNetwork()` and `plot()` for spatial networks.

## BUG FIXES

-   Bug in `sum_network_routes()` fixed (see [#240](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/240)).

# stplanr 0.2.2

## NEW FEATURES

-   In this release **sp** is demoted from a Depends to an Imports, meaning that all its functions will not be attached to your namespace (it will not be loaded) when you run `library(stplanr)`, making it less tied to **sp**. This is a continuation of the work to support **sf** and will make it easier for the package to work with alternative representations of geographic data.

## BUG FIXES

-   Bug in `geo_select_aeq.sf()` was fixed by Jakub Nowosad in pull [#238](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/238)
-   An issue with `od_aggregate.sf()` was fixed making it much faster

# stplanr 0.2.0

## NEW FEATURES

-   This is the largest release since the package was created, with dozens of changes to support simple features - see <https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/198> for details.
-   Support for **sf**. The package now support the new spatial class system for most functions.
-   New function `geo_bb()` supercedes `bb2poly()`. The new function can return polygons, points and matrix objects determined by the `output` argument. It also allows bounding boxes to be extended in metres, and scaled in x and y dimensions.
-   `geo_code()` now uses nominatim by default to find locations on the maps.
-   New function `od_coords()` takes a wide range of input data types to return a consistent output representing OD data as a data frame of origin and destination coordinates. This is used behind the scenes to make other functions more modular.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Plans for the next release

-   New generic `route()` function for routing. This is more flexible and user-friendly than the existing `line2route()` and `route_*()` functions it enhances.
-   Updated function names to make using **stplanr** easier and more intuitive.

# stplanr 0.1.9

## NEW FEATURES

-   Dependency cull: we have removed dependencies on foreach and doParallel

-   Bug with `google_dist()` fixed
-   Fixed fails due to breaking changes in dplyr

# stplanr 0.1.8

## NEW FEATURES

-   Depreciated `_each()` **dplyr** functions replaced with equivalent `_at` or `_all` functions.

# stplanr 0.1.7

## NEW FEATURES

-   There is a new vignette! See [vignettes/stplanr-paper.Rmd](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/blob/master/vignettes/stplanr-paper.Rmd) and `vignette("stplanr-paper")` for details.
-   The original [`introducing-stplanr`](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/blob/master/vignettes/stplanr.Rmd) vignette has been updated. It now provides a more basic introduction for people new to R for spatial and transport data.
-   `line2route()` has been refactored to improve error detection and allow `n_processes` arguments. Thanks @nikolai-b. See [pull/151](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/151) for details.
-   `line_match()` function added, a wrapper around `rgeos::gDistance()`, to find similar routes.
-   **RCurl** and **data.table** dependencies have been [removed](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/169)
-   **leaflet** has been demoted from an import to a suggest. This should reduce install times.
-   New functions `od_aggregate()` and `sp_aggregate()` have been [added](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/165), to enable OD data to be aggregated to new geographic levels.

## BUG FIXES

-   `#141` fixed: `viaroute()` works again.
-   [#153](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/153) fixed: `bidirectional = TRUE` returns a different result in `line_bearing()` now.

## FUTURE PLANS

-   A new branch that uses **sf** is being [tested](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/164). We may eventually transition to using simple features classes instead of **sp** classes.

# stplanr 0.1.6

## NEW FEATURES

-   `onewayid()` is now a generic function, meaning it can handle spatial and non-spatial data
-   New arguments provided for `line2route()` allow you to specify variables to join-by - also has updated and more sensible defaults
-   New function `od_id_order()` to put origin-destination ids in order, to identify 2 way duplicates (split out from `onewayid()`)

## BUG FIXES

-   See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
-   Bug in `route_cyclestreet()` leading `change_elev` and `av_incline` being wrong now fixed

-   New dataset `destinations` for showing how OD matrix with destinations can be converted to spatial data
-   New argument `list_output` allows the route information to be saved as a list, allowing `save_raw = TRUE` (which does not return a `Spatial` object) to be passed to the `route_` function.
-   tmap dependency removed for faster installs

BUG FIXES

-   Bug with `line2route()` (#124) fixed
-   Various improvements to documentation

## stplanr 0.1.4

NEW FEATURES

-   New function `reproject()` is a simple wrapper around `spTransform()` that uses `crs_select_aeq()` to convert a spatial object in geographic (lat/lon) coordinates into on with projected coordinates, with units of 1 m.
    This is useful for various spatial operations, such as finding the length and area of an object.

-   Implement `gprojected()`, a function for performing GIS operations on a temporary, projected, version of spatial objects.

-   Addition of `line_bearing()` to return the bearing of lines based on start and end points.

-   Addition of `angle_diff()` for finding the angular difference between lines: are they roughly parallel or perpendicular?

BUG FIXES

-   `line2df()` now works on lines with multiple vertices and is faster.

-   Fixes in the examples used to illustrate how `od_dist()` works.

## stplanr 0.1.3

NEW FEATURES

-   Update to OSRM functions to support API v5.

-   New parameter `byvars` in the `overline()` function, to allow disaggregation of results by a grouping variable (see `example(overline)`).

-   Faster implementation of `od2line()`: `od2line2()`.
    Plan is to replace the original if no issues are found with new implementation.

-   New function `od2odf()` which converts OD data into a dataframe of origins and destinations (feeds `od2line2()` but also useful as self-standing function).

-   New argument `new_proj` in `buff_geo()` allows the results to be exported to any coordinate reference system (CRS).

-   New function `gprojected()` generalises concept of `buff_geo()`, building on `crs_select_aeq()` to allow any GIS query to be conducted on a temporary projected version of spatial objects with geographical CRSs.

-   New function `od_dist()` can quickly calculate Euclidean distances of OD pairs without converting to spatial objects.

BUG FIXES

-   Bug fix in `onewayid()` so it captures all lines.

-   Various improvements to documentation and code.

## stplanr 0.1.2

NEW FEATURES

-   Interface to the Google Distance Matrix `API with dist_google`.

-   Update to `line2route`, allowing it to accept different routing funtions via the new argument `route_fun` (for testing - tested with `route_fun = route_cyclestreet`).

-   New functions for creating origin-destination data frames (`point2odf`) and SpatialLinesDataFrames (`points2flow`).

-   Addition of `n_vertices` and `is_linepoint` for identifying the number of vertices in spatial objects and whether the 'line' is really a point.

BUG FIXES

-   `line2route` refactored, with 10 fold speed increases on large (1000+) batches of lines.

## stplanr 0.1.0

NEW FEATURES

-   Addition of new class definition `SpatialLinesNetwork`, methods for `plot` and `summary` and functions `calc_network_routes` and `find_network_nodes` allowing fast route calculations via igraph and other network analysis functions.

-   Functions for removing beginning and end of lines: `toptail` and `toptailgs`.
    Helper functions `buff_geo`, `crs_select_aeq` and `line2points` added.

-   Functionality for reading in the UK's stats19 data: `read_stats19_*` functions download, unzip and re-categorise the data.

-   `read_table` functions added for reading Australian OD data.

-   `decode_gl` added to decode Google polylines and other functions for querying and reading data from OSRM services.

-   `gtfs2sldf` added to import GTFS routes as SpatialLinesDataFrames.

## stplanr 0.0.2

-   Published on CRAN
